        The Janata Shikshana Samiti,a pioneer in education, had its humble beginning way back in 1994 with the JSS Arts COllege started by the Karnataka Education Board with a merge strength of 40 students. Originally it was an intermediate college but later on the Science wing was added in 1949. In the year 1952, it ws taken over by the late R.S.Hukkerikar,a veteran freedom fighter,social worker and educationist. The JSS grew from strength to strength and various institutions were started to cater to the educational requirements of the people. Later, as the management faced financial crunch, they approached H H Vishweshateertha Swamiji of Pejavar math Udupi, and the reins of the Samiti were handed  over to pujya Sri Veerendra Heggade,Dharmadhikari of Srikshetra Dharmasthala. There onwards, Prof N.Vajrakumar was entrusted the task of developing the JSS group of institutions. Under his stewardship, the JSS flowered,flourished and fostered new centers of learning. Today the JSS stands tall atop Mailaralinga hill,2511 ft above sea level,along the Pune-Bangalore highway. The educational development due to JSS has also been so enormous that the adjoining area came to knowledge. At present there are 22 educational institutions with more than 14000 students in JSS campus.
